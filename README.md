### System Diagrams

This repository includes key system analysis diagrams:

- Business Function Decomposition Diagram (BFD)

- Data Flow Diagrams (DFD): Context level, Level 0, and selected Level 1 & 2 processes

- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

- Relational Data Model (RDM)

### Project Artifacts

- System analysis report (PDF)

- System and data modeling diagrams (BFD, DFD, ERD, RDM)

### Note: This project focuses on analysis and design, not system implementation or coding.
